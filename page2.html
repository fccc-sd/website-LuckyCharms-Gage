<h3>About </h3>

<div id="aboutSection">
    <p>I live in Bryan,Ohio i'm 16 years old and I go to <strong>Four County Career Center</strong>.
        I've wanted to do coding since I was little so this is a dream come true, and I can't wait to see what I learn.
        I broke my head open when I was in first grade becuase I was leaning back on two legs of a chair,and then I had
        to get my head super glued and the pillow got stuck to my head.
        I've been to <span id="importantPlace">Yellow stone national park</span>,and most of the states.</p>
