        <h1>About me: Gage McIntosh</h1>
        <p>I live in Bryan,Ohio i'm 16 years old and I go to <strong>Four County Career Center</strong>.  I've wanted to do coding since I was little so this is a dream come true, and I can't wait to see what I learn. I broke my head open when I was in first grade becuase I was leaning back on two legs of a chair,and then I had to get my head super glued and the pillow got stuck to my head. I've been to Yellow stone national park,and most of the states.</p>
